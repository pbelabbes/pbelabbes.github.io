# 6.x legacy forms

## Continue to use 6.x forms in Bonita BPM 7.x

From the **Execution** tab, in the **Form**, **Instantiation form**, and **Overview page** panes, you can choose the **_6.x_** option.   
This enables you to continue to use the 6.x forms in a Bonita BPM 7.x platform. You need to apply this configuration at each form, and each overview page. This means that a process can work with a mix of 6.x and 7.x forms/overview pages to make it easier to [migrate forms from 6.x]({{"bonita/7.5/application-and-process-design/page-and-form-development/ui-designer/migrate-a-form-from-6-x" | relative_url}}).

## Hide/Show 6.x specific features

When you no longer need access to the 6.x features, you can hide them to simplify the Bonita BPM Studio UI.

1. Go to **Preferences**.
2. In the **Other** category, click **6.x legacy**.
3. Uncheck the checkbox to hide some 6.x-only features.
